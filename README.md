## Description
My solution draws a "pitch" where are checkpoints (in meters) located.

After pressing the "Start"-button, two rectangles which represent cars are displayed and go off immediately.

(From now the "Start"-button is disabled for 10 seconds, so it will not be misused.)

A timer is started, which counts how long the respective car needs to reach the destination.

Both cars receive a random (between 50 and 100) speed [km/h].
Every 100 Meters a car can pickup a stone (random).

If one of the two cars pickup a stone, then it is randomly determined whether the car is 1 km/h faster or slower.

When one of the cars reach 1000 Meters then the timer will be stopped and the time that he needed saved in a file called "highscore.txt".


## Technical

The Pitch is 1000 px long , so that it represents a distance of 1km (1000 meters) but in pixels. 1 pixel = 1 meter. While generating random numbers for the speed, int stands for ten steps (10 / 20 / 30 km/h) and double for the single steps (1 / 2 / 3 / 7 km/h)

It means:
* 5.5 = 55 km/h
* 7.6 = 76 km/h
* 8.2 = 82 km/h

Sleep is set for 7 ms , because according to my calculations 7 ms  is almost exact representation of the reality.

___
**Reality:**
* 50 km/h = 13,88 m/s = 76 sec / km

**Program:**

* 50 km/h = ~7360 millisekunden / 1000px

**Compare:**

Program: 7360 ms / 1000px

Reality: 76 sec / 1000 meters
___

**Reality:**

* 55 km/h = ~15 m/s = 66 sec / km

**Program:**

* 55 km/h = ~6700 millisekunden /1000px

**Compare:**

Program: 6700ms/1000px
Reality: 66 sec/1000 meters
